# 🏥 Hospital Emergency Staffing Optimization

This research project investigates how to **optimize staffing and patient flow in hospital emergency departments**, conducted as part of the **URGE research program (Inria x AP-HP)**.

Overcrowded emergency rooms and limited medical staff require **efficient resource allocation**. This project combines **mathematical modeling, optimization, and crisis simulations** to improve hospital operations.

---

## ✅ Objectives

- Model patient flow using **Timed Petri Nets** to represent consultations, staff roles, and system dynamics.  
- Analyze **steady-state system capacity**: estimate how many patients can be treated based on staff composition and consultation times.  
- Develop an **integer linear programming model (ILP)** to optimize medical staff schedules under legal and organizational constraints.  
- Simulate **crisis scenarios** (sudden or prolonged patient surges) to evaluate queue growth and optimal reallocation of staff.

## 🛠️ Workflow

1. **Data & Assumptions** — Consultation times, patient categories, legal shift constraints.  
2. **Patient Flow Modeling** — Timed Petri Nets to simulate emergency department operations.  
3. **Capacity Analysis** — Steady-state calculation of patient throughput by staff structure.  
4. **Optimization (ILP)** — Staff scheduling under constraints (interns, doctors, night shifts…).  
5. **Crisis Simulation** — Patient influx scenarios to evaluate robustness & staffing strategies.  
6. **Results & Decision Support** — Insights for hospital managers and emergency planning.
